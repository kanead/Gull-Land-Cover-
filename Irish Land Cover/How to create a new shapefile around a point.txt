- Make sure everything has the same CRS otherwise it won't work

- Load in the point e.g. a set of coords on a csv. 

- Vector -> geoprocessing tools -> buffer 

- The input layer is the one containing the point 

- Set the buffer distance in metres. 

- Vector -> geoprocessing tools -> clip

- The input layer is the base from which you cut e.g. the total land cover map

- The clip layer is the cookie cutter e.g. the bird radius
